# Spam SMS Classifier

This project is a machine learning-based SMS spam classifier built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It uses various algorithms to classify whether an SMS is spam or not based on its content.

## Project Overview

The **Spam SMS Classifier** aims to identify spam messages in SMS data. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to predict whether a message is spam or ham (non-spam). The dataset is preprocessed and then split into training and testing data for model training.

## Features

- Data preprocessing (tokenization, removing stop words, etc.)
- Text vectorization using techniques like TF-IDF
- Machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.
- Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation

## Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `nltk`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
